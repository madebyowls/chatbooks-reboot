								<p>JustFamily is a shared photo library and family journal designed to help parents collect, safeguard, organize and enjoy their family memories.</p> 

								<p>You can access your JustFamily memories on the web and on your iPhone. You can also upload photos and videos easily using the Mac Uploader or the Windows Uploader.</p> 

								<p>Sharing memories with family and close friends inside of JustFamily is simple, private and secure. You can also share a memory beyond JustFamily to Facebook, Twitter or email with just a couple taps.</p>

								<p>JustFamily pricing is based on storage capacity.<p> 

								<p>You can get started with a free account that will allow you to store up to 1 GB of photos and videos. This typically means you’ll be able to upload and store between 400 - 500 photos.</p>

								<p>If you decide you want to store more photos at JustFamily you’ll have two options. A 100 GB account costs $5.99 per month. Most families will be able to store all of their photos and videos using the 100 GB plan. This plan will allow for something like 40,000 photos.</p>

								<p>For families with really large photo and video libraries, we also offer a 300 GB plan for $9.99 per month. Do you have 100,000 photos? This is the plan for you.</p>

                            <p>Just like in real life, there are two types of family members in JustFamily. In short, there are the people you live with and then the people who come to visit from time to time. In JustFamily, we use the labels “Household Members” and “Other Family” to make this distinction.</p>
							<p>You can read more about the distinction between Household Members and Other Family in <a href="http://blog.justfamily.com/post/62275218528/household-members-and-other-family-in-justfamily-v2-4">this blog post</a> </p>
							<p>You invite other family members to join you at JustFamily by tapping the “MyFamily” button in the top right of the “Me” section of JustFamily. Then invite family members, whether Household Members or Other Family, to join you by tapping the  “+Person” icon next to the appropriate header in the MyFamily list</p>

                            <p>Because you share a common Photo Library and Family Journal with your Household Members, you also share storage space with them. Here’s a simple example of how that works:</p>
							<p>You, your spouse and your two kids living at home all join JustFamily and sign up for free accounts. Each of you therefore receive 1 GB of storage space free. When the four of you connect as Household Members, your storage space is combined so that you jointly share 4 GB of storage space together. Then, when one of you upgrades to a premium 100 GB account those additional GB are added to your shared storage capacity.</p>
							<p>The four members of your Household now share 104 GB of storage space</p>
