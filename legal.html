					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>At JustFamily.com, we recognize the sensitivity of the confidential information that you share with our service, and we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. Your personal information belongs to you alone, and we do not make any claims to own it when you share it with us. We do not sell or rent it to anyone. We are vigilant about preventing unauthorized people from gaining access to it. This policy explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>
					<div class="question">
						<a href="#answer1" class="faq-toggle" data-toggle="collapse">How we collect and use information</a>
						<div id="answer1" class="collapse">
							<div class="answer">
								<p>We collect information in three ways: (1) you share information using the service, (2) you may purchase something from us, and you would give us credit or debit card information to do that, and (3) we collect some information automatically.</p>

								<p>We reserve the right to remove any information posted on JustFamily.com for any reason. Normally, we would only do this if we believe, in our judgment, that posted information: (i) infringes, misappropriates or violates a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (ii) violates, or encourages any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to civil liability; (iii) is fraudulent, false, misleading or deceptive; (iv) is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar or offensive; (v) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (vi) is violent or threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any other person; or (vii) promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances; or (vii) simply isn’t appropriate for a family audience.</p>

								<p>JustFamily.com enables people to discover and share information with one another in Family Groups. Information about the people who use the website is an integral part of the JustFamily.com experience. At a minimum, you must give us certain limited personal information to register as a member of JustFamily.com. The basic personal information we collect from new members includes:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Name</li>
									<li>A valid and verifiable email address</li>
									<li>Your digital content and related titles, captions, and annotations.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>You will also be required to select a password. Keeping the password secret is your responsibility. We are not responsible if you let the wrong people have your password, although we will do everything we can to help you if you notify us of a password breach.</p>
								<p>The personal information contained in any content you post to the service will be shared with other family or friends who become members of your Family Group. If you participate in community discussions and chats, we will capture that information. The amount and type of information you share voluntarily in these ways, and the decision whether to share posts, and with whom to share them, is always your choice.</p>
								<p>To personalize your experience on JustFamily.com and to improve our products and services, we may ask you to provide us with information about your personal or professional interests, demographics and experiences with our products or services. Providing this additional information is optional. If you elect not to share this information with us, it will not affect your access to the service.</p>
								<p>We will also use your email address and other member registration information to advise you of new members and new postings to your Family Group, to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from us or our affiliates, and to address customer service needs and requests.</p>
								<p>Other than members of your Family Group, access to your data is limited to our authorized staff and is restricted by our own internal password protection mechanisms.</p>
								<p>If you invite others to join JustFamily.com, or if you create administered accounts for other people, you may be asked to submit to us limited personal information about other people. For example, if you want to invite someone to join your Family Group, you will be asked to submit the invitee’s name and email address. In this circumstance, we only collect your invitee’s name and email address.</p>
								<p>Also, when you share content from your Family Group, we collect the email addresses of the recipients of any content you have elected to share with others. We will not disclose these email addresses to any third parties. (Please note, however, that these people will be able to forward your email containing the shared content to other parties, if they choose.)</p>

								<p>We currently do not take any financial information. In the future, some parts of the JustFamily.com experience may be available on a paid, continuous subscription basis, and we will also offer products and services for sale through our online store. To facilitate payment, we will request certain required personal information from you, including your personal credit card or debit card information.</p>
								<p>When you subscribe to any of the paid portions of our service or when you make a purchase from our online store, we will collect the following personal and financial information from you:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Name</li>
									<li>Billing address</li>
									<li>Shipping address</li>
									<li>Phone number</li>
									<li>Credit/debit card information</li>
									<li>Items purchased</li>

								<p>We will not share this financial information with anyone outside of our company, other than the financial institutions involved in processing your payment. We will comply in all respects with applicable consumer credit laws.</p>
								<p>Please note: If you click away from our website to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your payment card or other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy notices carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used.</p>

							<div class="answer">
								<p>In addition to the personal information you may provide to us as described above, we automatically collect non-personal information to make JustFamily.com work better for you. This non-personal information is not associated with information that can identify you. This information helps us evaluate how users and members use our service, such as data analysis, carrying out internal research on how our website is used, audits, developing new products and services, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.</p>
								<p>The technologies we use to gather this non-personal information include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our members and manage the performance of our website. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website.</li>
									<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are tiny files that are placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you visit our website. They let us immediately recognize you when you return to the site. This enables us, among other things, to personalize your experience with our site. Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer. Because cookies are stored on your computer, you can delete them whenever you want, but doing that might diminish your user experience. You may modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices regarding cookies. To learn more about cookies, please click http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</li>
									<li><strong>Web logs:</strong> To learn about how people use our website, we examine Web logs, which show the paths people take through our site and how long they spend in certain areas. We also use Web logs to detect the type of Web browser you are using so that we can optimize the performance of our Web site and understand the mix of browsers used by our members.</li>

								<p>We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our members. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of member data under our control. For example our security and privacy practices are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized personnel have access to personal information. We use secure server software to encrypt financial information you input before it is sent to us. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, although we use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent this.</p>

						<div id="answer19" class="collapse">
							<div class="answer">
								<p>JustFamily.com is a fee-based subscription Service. As a Member who subscribes to the Services (a "Subscriber"), you understand that membership in the Service is on a continuous service basis. This means that once you have become a Subscriber, your subscription will be automatically renewed and your credit card associated with that subscription will be charged based on the subscription program (e.g., annual, etc.) you have chosen. Credit card charges will be processed within 24 hours after you complete your subscription. Any products included with your subscription will be shipped promptly thereafter. You will be notified by email 30 days before your subscription automatically renews, and asked to correct any information which has changed. This notification will also be an opportunity to "opt out" of your renewal. Cancellation requests must be received two days before the renewal date for the cancellation to be effective.</p>
								<p>We may change our subscription prices at any time and from time to time. Each renewal of your subscription will be at the then standard renewal charge for the subscription period (e.g., annual, etc.) which you originally selected when you subscribed.</p>
